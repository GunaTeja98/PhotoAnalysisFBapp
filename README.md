### 2) Description

This Facebook app called “Facebook Photo guide” allows Facebook users to run an analysis on their photos, retrieved from their Facebook account. The Google Vision API is used to detect "labels" on selected photos. Based on those labels, our application will provide a brief analysis report to user, which will give an insight on the likes from his/her followers/friends. A date range selection is also used here which will allow users to select the date range in which the analysis should be done on their photos.
This application will enable user to take and upload more photos related to the labels detected on maximum liked photos and avoid uploading those which have labels with less/minimum likes. So, the user can post the photos by keeping in mind our app analysis and gain more reach, likes and followers on Facebook.
